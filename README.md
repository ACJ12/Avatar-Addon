# Avatar Addon V3
This addon simply adds the four nations bending abilities from the show Avatar the last Airbender, without needing experimental gameplay enabled, so it works on servers, realms, and already modded worlds with virtually no lag.
When you start the pack, run the command /function choose to pick your abilities. Don't worry, you can always go back by running the same command again (/function choose). If you want a player without command access to choose, enter /execute [their name] ~~~ function choose. The options are avatar, fire, earth, water, air, and human (normal vanilla Minecraft). To pick, punch to cycle through the options, and sneak when you want to confirm you choice. The moves and abilities of these classes are outlined below, and also in-game.
